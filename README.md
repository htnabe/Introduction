# Oh hey — I'm htnabe a.k.a Nabe-cyan

Just one-sided well-read holiday-developer from Kobe-city, Hyogo.

I’m into writing artcles on a ThinkPad, eating 🍿 caramel popcorn and pizza, reading + comics, listening to 90s-20s Japanese animes' songs and playing multi-player PC games.

I’m also enjoying 🚴 biking or running 🏃🏼 w/ few friends.
