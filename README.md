# Oh hey — I'm htnabe a.k.a Nabe-cyan

Just one-sided well-read holiday-developer from Kobe-city, Hyogo.

I'm passionate about contributing to the technical community through various articles.

You'll often find me immersed in writing on my ThinkPad, savoring 🍿 caramel popcorn and pizza, exploring both literature and comics, tuning in to the nostalgic tunes of 90s-20s Japanese anime, and engaging in multiplayer PC games.

In addition to my tech pursuits, I enjoy 🚴 biking or going for a run 🏃🏼 with a few friends.
