# Oh hey — I'm htnabe a.k.a Nabe-cyan

Just another stubbled, one-sided well-read holiday-developer from Matsue, Shimane.

I’m into [developing apps.](https://suep.netlify.app/) on a ThinkPad, cycling, eating 🍿 caramel popcorn and pizza, reading light novels + comics, listening to 90s-20s Japanese animes' songs and playing multi-player PC games.

When I’m not developing any apps, I do research in the field of vibration analysis and structural analysis. On any given day I use Octave to write codes for numerical calculations and physics simulations.

And if that wasn’t enough to keep me busy — I’m also enjoying 🚴 biking or running 🏃🏼 w/ few friends.
